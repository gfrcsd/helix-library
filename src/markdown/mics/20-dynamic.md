#### Description
The RE20 is an industry-standard large-diaphragm dynamic microphone, used worldwide on applications ranging from broadcast/VO to kick drum. It uses Electro-Voice’s patented Variable D design to control the microphone’s proximity effect. This allows the microphone to be used very close to a source without losing clarity, as can happen to other microphones due to the increase of bass response from proximity effect.
