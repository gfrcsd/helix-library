#### Description
The M160 is an unusual ribbon microphone, in that it has a hypercardioid pickup pattern. It is often paired with the M130 for mid-side stereo applications, in which the bidirectional M130 captures the “side” channel, and the M160 captures the “mid.” The M160 has two ribbons, mounted back-to-front just 0.5mm apart. The use of the second ribbon is said to increase the mic’s sensitivity, although it still measures at a modest 1.0 mV/Pa.
