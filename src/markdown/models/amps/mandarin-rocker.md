#### Note

Line 6 decided to slightly alter the model so that at lower settings, the Drive knob's taper exhibits a smoother transition into distortion.

#### Description

Celebrating its 10th Anniversary in 2014, the Rockerverb Series demonstrates better than anything else that a workhorse amp can be a master of all trades. The original Rockerverb was actually our first ever ‘high gain’ amplifier, with a unique voice that quickly became a firm favourite amongst the heavy crowd. However, its supreme versatility and dependability meant the series has been a mainstay for touring artists and session aces, both on the road and in the studio.

The Rockerverb 100 MKIII head combines over a decade of user feedback with a number of new details and improvements. In a first for the Rockerverb Series, the MKIIIs include selectable output power options to manipulate headroom and volume, switching down to 70, 50 or 30W. The MKIII also features the same footswitchable attenuator that has been so popular with users of our Thunderverb and Dual Dark Series amps.

The Clean channel has been revoiced on the new MKIIIs for a more ‘chimey’ response, but still retains the warmth and vintage character of a non-master volume design. The new models now have even greater headroom than previous versions, whilst the valve driven spring reverb now has a more extensive range with a brighter trail. Add to this a host of other hidden refinements and you have the finest sounding and most feature-laden Rockerverb to date.
