#### Description
So we took the success of the M6 Carbine™ as our compass point and set out to create a full featured, high power version of this simple, intuitive platform.

Bassists the world over responded overnight to the new clarity, on-demand attack and crystal-clear definition of the M6's Trans-Class™ All-Tube preamp and MOSFET power. They love that it's easy to dial and yet offers all the versatility they need via the power of the rotary VOICE feature. The next step in the evolution of this dynamo was obvious. Add substantially more power and endow the preamp with a full set of studio-quality EQ and dynamic features… enter the M9 Carbine.
