#### Description
This is the Legendary Hiwatt Circuit that started it all - each DR103 is an authentic and faithful reproduction of Dave Reeves’ original amplifier. The Hiwatt Custom 100 is still proudly hand built and hand-wired in our Custom Shops in England to Harry Joyce’s exacting military specifications. This amplifier is a must have for the artist who can hear and appreciate the sonic difference the best quality English made transformers can produce. Used by many of the world’s most iconic bands and guitarists both on stage and in the studio, this amp is a rock and roll legend.
