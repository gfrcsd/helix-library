#### Description
Featuring two highly evolved channels, capable of clean tones that shimmer like icicles in the deep of winter moonlight and tube saturation that is so rich and powerful it should be illegal in the free world. Foot-switchable boost function for both channels, variable for channel 2.

The Shiva is a masterful study of refined elegance, providing the synergy of one's heart and hands.
