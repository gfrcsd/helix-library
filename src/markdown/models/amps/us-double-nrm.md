#### Description
The Fender Twin and Twin Reverb are guitar amplifiers made by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. The Twin was introduced in 1952, two years before Fender began selling Stratocaster electric guitars. The amps are known for their characteristically clean tone.

The Twin has seen a number of revisions since its introduction, both internal and external, with its designs sometimes varying greatly from one year to the next. Several variations on the amp's original design have been produced through the years, including the Twin Reverb, the Super Twin, the Twin Reverb II, and the Twin Reverb '65 Reissue. The Cyber Twin, which combined a tube amp with a digital processor, was introduced in January 2001.

Many notable musicians have used Fender Twin amplifiers, including Mark Knopfler, David Gilmour, Chuck Berry, Mike Oldfield, The Beatles (1968 Twin Reverb amps using the AC568 circuit), Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards (Rolling Stones), Steve Jones (Sex Pistols), Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead), Eric Johnson, Joe Bonamassa and Tommy Emmanuel.
