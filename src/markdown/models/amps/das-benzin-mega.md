#### Description

The mighty VH4 head is the powerhouse that put Diezel on the map. Dissatisfied with the sounds from commonly available amps, rocker Peter Diezel created the VH4 tone monster in 1994 just to please himself â€“ and got so many requests from tone-hungry fellow guitarists for their own Diezel amps that he had to put the VH4 into production.

The VH4 head features a beefy 100 Watt output section with four distinctly-voiced preamp channels, each with separate gain, EQ and master controls. Other useful features include series and parallel loops, plus four channel inserts to add pedals or rack effects to any single channel.
