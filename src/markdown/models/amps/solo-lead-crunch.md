#### Description
Soldano’s Super Lead Overdrive 100 (SLO-100) set the standard for modern high-gain amplification. It all started in 1987, when Seattle-native Mike Soldano built one of the first high-gain amp heads with searing harmonics and the perfect balance of gain, sustain and tight touch response. Soon after Mike moved to Los Angeles and displayed his revolutionary amp at the 1987 NAMM show. It didn’t take long for the industry to take notice. The now legendary SLO-100 had arrived!

The SLO completely changed what players came to expect from amps. They shelved their old amps and replaced them with this foot-switchable 100-watt monster, loaded with player-friendly features. While the amp’s drive channel found it backing up renowned rock guitarists like Mick Mars (Motley Crue), Warren de Martini (Ratt), and Howard Leese (Heart), its clear and tactile clean channel and bluesy crunch also made the SLO the first choice for non-metal stalwarts, such as Mark Knopfler, Eric Clapton, Warren Haynes, Gary Moore and Lou Reed to name a few.
