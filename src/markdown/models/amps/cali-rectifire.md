#### Description
It’s been more than 25 years, two generations of guitarists and several musical trend-cycles since the Dual Rectifier® first unleashed its crushing wall of gain on radio. In that time many have mimicked, modeled, dissected and plagiarized it, but it remains firmly planted at the center of heavy music; a Rock icon.

Over a decade ago the Recto® underwent a massive facelift that greatly expanded its versatility and took what was a 2 Channel amp aimed squarely at high gain only – to a 3 Channel amp capable of roaming any style confidently.

While still leaving the widest, deepest footprint in heavy music, the Dual Rectifier has become the amp of choice for a long list of chart topping devotees outside the world of heavy.
