#### Description
The Park 75 is another version of the classic four input, two channel British plexi circuit that employs KT88 tubes. It features hand wiring, it features high quality parts, and custom transformers, all housed in a Park small box format head shell. As with all Park amps we use carefully selected parts to recreate the sound and feel of the originals including custom USA made transformers (built the old fashioned way with paper bobbins), light-weight welded aluminum chassis, custom Park banana knobs and Park black plexi block go. This amp is a wolf in sheep's clothing. By using KT88s and the same transformers as the Park 50, the Park 75 puts out 50 watts clean and 90 watts at full tilt!
