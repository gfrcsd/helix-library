#### Description
Bass is the lynch pin between rhythm and melody …a big responsibility. The essential ingredients of great bass tone are Pitch, Punch and Power. Pitch, so the frequency of the note is identifiable and accurate, not the flubby rumble often heard. Punch, so the attack of each note is a precise event in time. And Power to deliver these two with authority and headroom …and to disembowel the first five rows!

Artists often call to rave about the Bass 400+™ after switching from bi- or tri- amped rigs of up to a thousand watts—exclaiming the joy of stepping forward in the mix, even to the point of leading the band. String definition so articulate that the rhythm section locks together to become one machine of unstoppable momentum.
