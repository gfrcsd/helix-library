#### Description
A real hot amp, this Fireball - the name says it all. Already in the Clean Channel, shimmering Crunch sounds can be achieved with the middle position of the Gain control. The Gain potentiall is continued in the Lead Channel and flourishes there really. Get ready for any kind of metal playing, no matter how heavy. Who needs external distortion pedals? With the Mid Boost, itâ€™s still great to keep the sound going. Sheer 6L6GC tube power brings the right punch and sophisticated twisting structure.
