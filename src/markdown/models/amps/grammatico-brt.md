#### Description

Based on a Tweed Deluxe and designed to capture the tones of early ZZ Top, Neil Young, Keith Richards, Tom Petty, George Thorogood, Kenny Burrell, T-Bone Walker, and many other classic rock tones when plugged straight into the amp. It accepts either single coils or humbuckers equally well.

The tone is very woody, warm, round, and fat with throaty mids and sweet rounded highs with just enough zing to make it exciting and cutting. Itâ€™s very organic, transparent, three dimensional with lots of bloom and harmonic richness.
