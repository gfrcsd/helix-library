### Description

Essentially with the same design and sound this cabinet is a reshaped cube to originally accommodate our Shiva head. The recessed back panel gives it the same inner volume. If you are looking for a closed back 1x12 cabinet to fit the Shiva as well as smaller to medium sized heads like our Duende, Metropolis or one of the International Amplifiers this cab is a great choice. Comes loaded with a Celestion Classic 80 at 16 ohm to handle the power of a Shiva.
