#### Description
First introduced way back in 1975, the JC-120 Jazz Chorus is one of the few guitar amps that can truly be called a legend. Roland’s long-standing flagship is universally recognized by pros as the benchmark in clean guitar sound, and its rich tone and famous built-in stereo chorus effect have been heard on countless popular songs over its long history. Now celebrating 40 years of continuous production and counting, the JC-120 remains the undisputed “king of clean,” and the enduring choice of serious guitarists everywhere.
