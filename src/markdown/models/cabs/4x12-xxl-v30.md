#### Description

The E412XXL will take you into a new dimension of metal sounds! The slanted speaker arrangement provides the dispersion characteristics of a conventional 4x12 cab, but the straight housing in XXL format offers even more speaker volume, and thus the decisive bonus of super-fat low end and tighter mids. Put simply, this is never-ending headroom! It optimally supports the mid-sized sound of an electric guitar too. Add the Celestion Vintage 30s to all that, and we have built a classic among guitar cabs here!
