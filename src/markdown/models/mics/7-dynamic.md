#### Description
The Shure SM7B is an industry standard dynamic microphone. It has been the flagship of Shure’s dynamic mic product line for years, and has a reputation for being a go-to studio mic for numerous sources, including vocals. The mic’s moving-coil cartridge is similar to the Unidyne III design found in the SM57/SM58.
