#### Description
Truly a classic microphone, the MD 421 has been a fixture in recording studios since its introduction in 1960. The MD421 has a 5-position bass roll-off switch. The switch is not marked with specific frequencies or amounts (dB) of cut. The “flat” position is marked M for Music; the other extreme is marked “S” for Speech, and cuts the low end by approximately 6dB below 500 Hz. Three intermediate positions are provided.
