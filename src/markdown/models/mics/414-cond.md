#### Description
The C 414 B-TL II is a transformerless multipattern FET condenser microphone — essentially, a transformerless version of the long-lived C414 B-ULS. It is a descendant of AKG’s classic C 414 microphone, and the first of the “gold grille” series that resulted in the B-XL II and XL II.
