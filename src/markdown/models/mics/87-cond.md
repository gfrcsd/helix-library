#### Description
The U 87 was designed as a solid-state version of the U 67 tube microphone. It retained the K67-style capsule of the U67, but replaced the tube amplifier circuit with a FET/transformer design. In short, the U87 was a tripolar FET condenser with a transformer-coupled output. A switch below the headbasket allowed selection of Cardioid, Omni, or Figure-8 patterns.
