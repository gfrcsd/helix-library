#### Description
The 4038 is a classic Studio Ribbon Microphone designed by the BBC and originally manufactured by STC. Coles, the outsourced manufacturer, bought the rights to the STC microphone line in 1974. The micâ€™s frequency response is flat from 30 to 15,000 Hz. The ribbon maintains a uniform figure-of-eight polar response in both the horizontal and vertical planes.
