#### Description
The D30 VR is a dynamic kick drum microphone from AKG. As part of the VR series, it is presented as a vintage reissue, although like the C12 VR, it combines vintage and contemporary elements into an altogether new result. The D12 VR contains a unique phantom-powered pad/filter circuit. The mic can be used without phantom power, as a purely dynamic microphone.
