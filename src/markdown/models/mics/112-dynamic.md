#### Description
The D112 is a classic large-diaphragm dynamic kick drum mic, with high SPL capabilities (160 dB). The frequency response is tailored for kick drum, and as is often true of such mics, is applicable for other low-frequency instruments such as floor tom, bass cab, upright bass, and some brass instruments; there is a LF peak at 100 Hz and a mid-high presence peak around 3500 Hz.
