#### Description
The Battering Ram is an Overdrive + Fuzz pedal which works equally well for guitar or bass or anything else you want to plug into it. Overdrive + Fuzz means that the overdrive and fuzz channels can work in parallel, each channel receiving the instrument signal and mixed together. Version 2.0 of the Battering Ram adds the SPLIT switch which allows either channel to be on separately instead of in parallel.
