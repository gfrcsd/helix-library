#### Description

Spring Reverb

#### Settings

- **Dwell** — Adjusts the strength of the signal sent into the spring tank. Higher values result in a longer decay
- **Spring Count** — Sets how many springs are in the tank (1, 2, or 3, and numerous values in between)
- **Drip** — Adjusts the intensity of the spring reverb, or how much "ploink" you might hear
- **Low Cut** — Applies a low cut (or high pass) filter to the reverb, letting you remove the effected signal below a certain frequency
- **High Cut** — Applies a high cut (or low pass) filter to the reverb, letting you remove the effected signal above a certain frequency
- **Mix** — Controls the wet/dry mix of the reverb. When set to 0%, no reverb is heard; when set to 100%, no dry signal is heard
- **Level** — Controls the overall output level of the block
- **Trails** — When on, reverb decay continues to ring out after the block is bypassed
