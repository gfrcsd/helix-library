#### Description
One of Maxon's most esoteric models, the SD-9 has gained a huge cult following since its initial release in the early 1980s. The SD-9 has long been prized for its ability to provide an immense range of distorted tones, from punchy overdrive to blistering fuzz, all with full-frequency response and minimal tonal coloration.
