#### Description
The Fuzz Face's continuing popularity and status as a classic may be explained by its many famous users, which include Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Duane Allman, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Pete Townshend, Eric Johnson and George Harrison. The Fuzz Face has a low input impedance and thus is very sensitive to the guitar pickup. By rolling the volume knob, the guitar player can decrease the gain of the pedal and get a clean or crunch sound, while still having all the gain when the volume knob is on maximum.[clarification needed] For the same reason, Fuzz Face pedals react differently when placed directly after the guitar than when after other pedals or after a buffer amplifier.
