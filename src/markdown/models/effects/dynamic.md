### Description

This new Split block type lets you dynamically route signals to Path B, depending on how hard you play. For example, you could roll your guitar’s volume back a bit and play clean chords through a Grammatico on Path A and then roll it back up and dig in to blend in a searing Revv Gen Purple lead on Path B

- Knob 1 (Threshold)—Signals below the Threshold are routed to Path A; signals above the Threshold are routed to Path B
- Knob 2 (Attack)—Determines how fast the signal routes to Path B once reaching the Threshold
- Knob 3 (Decay)—Determines how fast the signal returns to Path A once falling below the Threshold
- Knob 4 (Reverse)—Swaps dynamic path routing. When set to “On”, signals below the Threshold are routed to Path B and signals above the Threshold are routed to Path A
