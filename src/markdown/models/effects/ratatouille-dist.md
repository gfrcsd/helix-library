#### Description

The RAT will be your go-to distortion pedal for every gig, whether it’s rock, blues, punk, or jazz. This is the standard that all other distortion devices are measured against. Heard on thousands of recordings, it has helped define the sound of the past three decade’s most influential bands.

#### Note

Turns out the [Vermin Dist](/models/effects/vermin-dist/) model was broken. Line 6 was going to replace it completely but a bunch of people had presets with the old version. On top of that, they found out their RAT's LM308 chip had crapped out since they modeled it last so they decided to get it into perfect working order and start from scratch.

#### Settings

- **Gain** — Sets the amount of distortion
- **Filter** — Sets the amount of high cut (low pass) filter applied to the distortion; basically letting more treble through (lower values) or filtering it out (higher values)
- **Level** — Sets the overall level of the block
