#### Description

Effect simulates playing a signal back from an analog tape machine. This signal can be distorted, filtered to sound older or more lo-fi, and modulated with wow and flutter.

#### Settings

- **Wow Fluttr** — Determines how much warbly tape sound is heard
- **Saturation** — Adds analog tape saturation and at high enough settings, distortion. At lower settings, it's great for simply warming up a tone
- **Low Cut** — Determines the frequency of the Low Cut (High Pass) filter. At higher settings, can provide a lo-fi effect
- **High Cut** — Determines the frequency of the High Cut (Low Pass) filter. At lower settings, can provide the natural high-end roll-off of old tape
- **Tape Speed** — Changes both the rate of the modulation applied by the Wow Fluttr control and the filtering response of the analog tape emulation
- **Level** — Sets the overall level of the block
- **Texture** — Adjusts the amount of the NAB tape EQ in the simulated tape path. When Saturation is set to 0.0, the texture is invisible. When Saturation is turned up, the texture will affect the tightness (or looseness) of the distortion
