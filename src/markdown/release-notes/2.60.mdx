        <strong>
          Add a Looper > 1 Switch Looper block to your preset and assign it to a
          stomp footswitch.

        (Adding a 1 Switch Looper to HX Effects from Stomp view automatically
        assigns it to the selected footswitch.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Press the 1 Switch Looper switch.</strong> The LED lights red,
        indicating the loop is recording.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Press the 1 Switch Looper switch again.</strong> The LED lights
        green, indicating the loop is playing back.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Press the 1 Switch Looper switch again.</strong> The LED lights
        amber, indicating the loop is in overdub mode. Subsequent presses of the
        switch toggle between play and overdub mode.

        The most recent recording is undone. Holding the switch again will redo
        the recording. On Helix, Helix Rack/Control, and HX Effects, “UNDO” or
        “REDO” briefly appears on the scribble strip. On Helix LT, “UNDO” or
        “REDO” briefly appears in Performance view.

        <strong>Quickly double-press the 1 Switch Looper switch.</strong>{" "}
        Playback/recording stops and the LED lights white, indicating a loop is

# Improvements/Changes

- The most recent new HX Reverb models have been tweaked to sound notably wetter (see Known Issues below)
- When changing the Time parameter, Legacy delay models now exhibit a more organic behavior (more like DL4 and Echo Pro)
- The Looper block is now called “6 Switch Looper” (see Known Issues below)
- Synchronizing to incoming MIDI clock has been improved
- The Mix parameter defaults of both mono and stereo HX Reverbs are now consistent
- When loading a preset, its default MIDI program change message would be transmitted after the preset is loaded and any Instant commands were sent. This PC message is now sent immediately when the preset is selected
- Helix, Helix Rack/Control, Helix LT only: Shuriken Variax bank names now appear in the Input > Multi and Input > Variax block without requiring connection to Variax Workbench
- HX Effects only: On the Signal Flow page, if the Split block is selected and bypassed, it now appears with a different icon than when it’s enabled
- Many under-the-hood improvements

- Many other minor bug fixes and optimizations

# Known Issues

- As the new HX Reverb models have been tweaked to sound notably “wetter”, any existing user presets that use these models will sound different. Although Helix and HX hardware has the ability to compensate for changes made to models when rebuilding presets (and one of our goals is to rarely if ever cause audible changes to existing user presets), the improvements made to the reverb blocks unfortunately cannot be compensated for
- Existing user presets containing Helix’s classic Looper block will continue to read “Looper” instead of “6 Switch-Looper” until the model is changed and the preset is re-saved. This is normal and does not affect operation
- In rare cases, pitch artifacts may be heard on selected delay blocks when the Time parameter is set to Note Sync values higher than 1/2 Triplet
