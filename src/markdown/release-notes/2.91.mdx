# Updating to 2.91

## STEP 1 — Updating HX Edit to 2.90 (assuming you haven’t done this already)
1. Log onto line6.com , download, and install HX Edit 2.90: 
    - macOS: https://line6.com/software/readeula.html?rid=9678
    - Windows 7/8/10: https://line6.com/software/readeula.html?rid=9677 

## STEP 2 — Updating Helix/HX Firmware to 2.91
1. If you have Helix Rack/Control, turn off Helix Control. Also, shut down all Line 6 software or any programs that use audio, like DAWs, iTunes, Spotify, video games, etc.
2. Connect your Helix/HX device to a Mac or PC via USB (do not use any sort of USB hub, which may include the front USB ports on towers) and turn it on.
3. Launch the new version of HX Edit 2.90 you installed in Step 1 above. If you’re not signed in, click “Check for Updates” in the lower right corner and sign in. If you’re already signed in, a dialog panel appears, indicating an update is available.
4. Click “Update Now.” A window appears, asking you to back up your Helix / HX hardware. Click OK, optionally rename the backup and / or choose a different destination folder, and then click “Create Backup.” IMPORTANT! Note the location where you’ve saved the backup.
5. Continue following the prompts. Once updated, the window reads “Update Complete” and your Helix / HX hardware begins rebuilding its presets; wait for this to complete and click “Back to HX Edit.”
6. From the File pull-down menu, click “Restore from backup…” A dialog appears. Click “Restore Backup” and then “Yes.”
7. Turn your Helix / HX product off and then on again.
8. If you have Helix Control connected to Helix Rack, turn on Helix Control. Helix Rack reads “Helix Control must be updated to work properly.” Press Knob 6 (OK). 

# Bug Fixes in 2.91

# Known Issues in 2.91

- While backing up, the scribble strip on FS8 can sometimes flicker (Helix Floor, Helix RackControl)/
- In very rare cases, leaving the unit on for many hours can sometimes cause reverb models to cease outputting audio
- In a preset with two IRs blocks, moving one IR block to Path B can sometimes cause the other IR block to reset its Impulse Response to slot 1
- In rare cases, after exporting and then importing presets using HX Edit, the Split block’s bypass state can sometimes change (Helix Floor, Helix RackControl, Helix LT)/
- When using Blue Cat Audio’s PatchWork VST host software, resizing the Helix Native window may not scale smoothly (Helix Native)
