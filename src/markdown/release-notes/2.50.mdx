# Improvements/Changes
- 12 of Helix’s 17 reverbs originally appeared in M-Class processors and Verbzilla. As such, they’ve been moved into the new “Legacy” subcategory within the Reverb category
- Helix's tempo no longer responds to pressing TAP at tempi lower than 40.0 BPM (Beats Per Minute). This is to ensure that multiple fast tap entries are recognized properly, as previously, they could be seen as one really slow tap entry. You may still manually select a tempo all the way down to 20.0 BPM and your presets can still be saved with tempi down to 20.0 BPM—just touch TAP and turn Knob 6 (BPM)

# Bug Fixes
- In some cases, when Global Settings > MIDI/Tempo > Duplicate PC Send was set to "Off," duplicate PC messages could still be sent—FIXED
- In rare cases, MIDI note commands set to momentary could switch to “latching”—FIXED
- If its Mid and Bass parameters are set to 0.0, the Cali IV Lead Amp/Amp+Cab model could sometimes exhibit a decrease in gain—FIXED
- If snapshot names have been cleared, preset names could sometimes appear blank when switching from Snapshot footswitch mode to Preset footswitch mode—FIXED
- Helix LT: After restoring Global Settings from HX Edit, the EXP 1/2 LEDs could become responsive—FIXED
- Quickly switching between snapshots could cause Command Center > CC Toggle messages to send incorrect MIDI CC data—FIXED
- Other bug fixes and optimizations

# Known Issues
- Shuriken bank names only appear after connecting a Shuriken Variax guitar to Helix and opening Variax Workbench HD software
- When using two 1024 IR's in a preset, moving the upper IR block before or after a pre/post split block can change the sonic character of the IR block
- In rare cases, pitch artifacts may be heard on selected delay blocks when the Time parameter is set to Note Sync values higher than 1/2 Triplet
