# New Features
- Support for HX Edit—Helix, Helix Rack/Control, and Helix LT now work with the new HX Edit application (Mac/PC)
- Full State Backup and Restore—Helix supports the all-new HX Edit application’s ability to perform full-state backup and restore. <p className="has-text-danger">IMPORTANT! You MUST be running Helix firmware 2.20 or higher to use full state backup and restore!</p> **In HX Edit, from the File pulldown menu, select “Create Backup…” Click [Create Backup] to confirm. To restore from a backup, from the File pulldown menu, select “Restore From Backup…” From the Backup File pulldown, select the desired backup and click [Restore Backup].** You may choose to restore any combination of 8 setlists, IRs (including the index order), and/or Global Settings.
- Global Settings > MIDI/Tempo > Duplicate PC Send—Before 2.30, Helix would purposely omit MIDI PC messages with an identical value as the previous PC message. You may now choose to send duplicate PC messages
- LFO reset—Stepping on TAP once now resets any LFO-based effects, such as tremolos and rotary speakers
- Support for Variax Shuriken banks—When a Variax Shuriken is connected, Helix’s Input > Multi and Input > Variax blocks will reflect the proper factory bank names. These bank names are retained until a James Tyler Variax or Variax Standard is connected
