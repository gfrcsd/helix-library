- HX Stomp XL only—The colors for Distortion and Reverb boxes on Play view were reversed—FIXED
- Receiving a MIDI CC67 could cause Helix LT to freeze—FIXED
- In some cases, a MIDI snapshot (CC69) message could fail to be recognized if sent immediately after a PC message—FIXED

## Helix Native/HX Edit 3.11

### How do I update to 3.11?

Any chance you've already updated HX Edit to 3.01 (released on Feb 2, 2021) or 3.10 (released on April 15, 2021)? **If so, just connect Helix/HX to your computer via USB and launch HX Edit.** The software will walk you through the entire procedure, including backing everything up to your computer.

### I updated but why don't I see [Model X]?

HX Edit can't magically see new models added to your Helix/HX hardware; you must update HX Edit at well. Here's a link:

- _**macOS:**_ https://line6.com/software/readeula.html?rid=10574
- _**Windows:**_ https://line6.com/software/readeula.html?rid=10576

### My Helix/HX is at version X.XX. Can I go straight to 3.11?

Absolutely, but note that if you're starting with a version lower than **2.80**, the update will appear to happen twice. This is normal.

### Anything else I should know?

Yes. <span className="has-text-danger">We <strong className="has-text-danger">STRONGLY</strong> recommend performing a factory reset <strong className="has-text-danger">AFTER UPDATING</strong> your Helix/HX firmware to 3.11 and <strong className="has-text-danger">THEN RESTORING YOUR BACKUP.</strong></span> (Backing up is part of the update process). Here's how to perform a factory reset.

  <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP FIRST, AS A FACTORY
  RESET WILL ERASE ALL YOUR WORK!
