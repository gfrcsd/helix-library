**Helix/HX Firmware 2.82**, **HX Edit 2.82**, and **Helix Native 1.82** contain numerous bug fixes and is strongly recommended for all Helix and HX users.

As 2.80 (released 18. July 2019) contained massive changes to the underlying Helix architecture, it required a fairly involved double-update procedure. Once your Helix/HX hardware has been updated to 2.80, however, it's much simpler to update to newer versions. Therefore, we've provided two distinct update procedures, depending on the current firmware of your Helix/HX hardware.

If you're not sure which firmware your Helix/HX hardware is running, just restart it and look at the display.

      The following instructions are only for those who have not yet updated
      their Helix/HX Hardware to 2.80. If you're already at 2.80, jump up to the
      section "Updating to 2.81 from 2.80 or 2.81 (READ ME!)"
    </p>

## STEP 1a - Backing Up Helix/HX Hardware

1. **Connect your Helix/HX processor to a Mac or PC via USB and turn it on.** Do not use any sort of USB hub.
2. **Open YOUR CURRENT VERSION of HX Edit (NOT the new HX Edit 2.82).**
3. **From the top File menu, select "Create Backup..."**
4. **Click "Create Backup."**

  <div className="message-body">
    <p>
      If you want to load the 2.8X factory presets and hotkey templates, it's
      better to manually back up individual setlists, so you can later import
      them into empty setlists. To do this,{" "}
      <strong>
        from the preset library along the left side, select the setlist you want
        to back up and click "Export." Choose a destination folder and click
        "Save." Repeat for any other setlists you want to back up.
      </strong>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## STEP 1b - Backing Up Helix Native

If you don't currently own Helix Native, skip this step.

1. **Open any instance of Helix Native 1.80 (NOT the new Helix Native 1.82) within your DAW and click the "My Account" button in the lower left corner to open the Preferences window.**
2. **From the General tab, click "Export Bundle."**
3. **Choose the destination folder and click "Save."**

## STEP 2 - Updating HX Edit to 2.82

<span className="title is-size-5 has-text-danger">
  (YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE UPDATING YOUR HELIX/HX FIRMWARE!)
</span>

1. **Turn off or disconnect any connected Helix or HX hardware.**
2. **Log onto line6.com. Once logged in, download the latest version of HX Edit, available here:**
   - [HX Edit 2.82 for Max OS X](https://line6.com/software/readeula.html?rid=9314)
   - [HX Edit 2.82 for Windows 7, 8, or 10](https://line6.com/software/readeula.html?rid=9315)
3. **Read the Software License Agreement (hahaahaaa!) and click "Accept and Download."**
4. **Once the software has downloaded, double-click the installer and follow the prompts.**

<div className="message is-warning">
  <div className="message-header">
    <p>NOTE</p>
  </div>
  <div className="message-body">
    <p>
      Installing HX Edit 2.82 automatically installs the latest version of Line
      6 Updater, which is required to update the firmware.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## STEP 3a - Updating Helix Floor/Rack/LT to 2.82

<span className="title is-size-5 has-text-danger">
  (DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE UPDATED HX EDIT TO 2.821!)
</span>

If you have HX Effects or HX Stomp, skip to STEP 3b below instead.

1. If you have Helix Rack/Control, **turn off Helix Control. Also, shut down all Line 6 software or any programs that use audio, like DAWs, iTunes, Spotify, video games, etc.**
2. **Connect Helix to a Mac or PC via USB (do not use any sort of USB hub) and turn it on.**
3. **Launch Line 6 Updater.** The latest version was automatically installed when you installed HX Edit 2.82 in "STEP 2—Updating HX Edit to 2.82" above.
4. **Enter your Line 6 Username and Password and click "Sign In."** A big green box appears with a picture of your Helix product. **Click the big green box and then click "Update" next to Version: 2.82.**
5. **Carefully read the instructions (HEY! DID YOU BACK UP FIRST?), click "Continue," and then "Accept."** A warning dialog appears, telling you that Helix will be reset twice.
6. **Think "Hmm, maybe I should've backed up first? Nah, I insist on subverting the dominant paradigm," and click "OK."** Helix begins updating. As wholly expected, because we warned you... because you always read the instructions... halfway through the update process, Line 6 Updater displays a second dialog and Helix's LCD reads "Boot Failure. Entered Update Mode!" **THIS IS NORMAL. DO NOT FREAK OUT, TAKE A PHOTO, AND THEN POST IT ONLINE BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU FOR NOT READING THESE INSTRUCTIONS.**
   - ![Screenshot](https://line6.com/media/ips/uploads/monthly_2019_07/MoveAlong.jpg.178f5fc3b9e6bdeec47d4a5935e47444.jpg)
7. **Click "OK" again.** When finished, Helix restarts automatically and begins rebuilding your presets. Let it finish.
   - <p className="has-text-danger">
       <strong className="has-text-danger">IMPORTANT!</strong> This may take
       some time. If Helix appears to not respond for many minutes, see the
       message directly below step 8.
     </p>
8. If you have Helix Rack/Control, **turn on Helix Control**. Helix Rack reads "Helix Control must be updated to work properly. Update now?" **Press Knob 6 (OK) to update Helix Control**.

      If you run into an issue during the update process such as the update
      procedure not completing or if you receive an error message, we strongly
      recommend trying a different USB port and/or USB cable. USB 2.0 or greater
      ports and cables are highly recommended. For Windows computers, USB ports
      on the back of desktop PCs have proven to be the most reliable.

      If you instead exported individual setlists and loaded the 2.8X factory
      presets/templates (and want to keep them), from the preset list along the
      left side, select an empty User setlist and then drag the saved setlist
      file (from the tip in STEP 1) into the preset list

      You may notice that after restoring from a backup (or loading in
      previously stored setlists or individual presets) that preset switching
      times are slower than normal. Restart Helix/HX, and you'll see the display
      read "Rebuilding preset [XXX]". Wait for it to rebuild your presets, and
      they will load faster.

# Bug Fixes in 2.82

- When a stomp footswitch is used to toggle a parameter’s min and max values, in some cases the dim/lit state of the LED could become inverted
- After importing a preset, certain blocks could appear in HX Edit but may not appear in the hardware
- In rare cases, selecting snapshots could result in an error
- While in Snapshot footswitch mode, the first press of a Bank Up or Bank Down switch could sometimes function backwards
- When Global Settings > Footswitches > Preset Mode Switches is set to "Stomp/Snap," copying snapshots could inadvertently switch to Snapshot mode
- When Global Settings > MIDI/Tempo > Tempo Select is set to “Per Snapshot”, tempo-synced effects could respond as Authentic even when set to Transparent
- Ptich/Synth > 3 OSC Synth, 3 Note Generator, and 4 OSC Generator models are louder than in 2.71. IMPORTANT! Regrettably, this will affect any presets containing these effects that were made since 2.80
- On rare occasions, footswitches could become stuck in Snapshot mode
- The Dynamics > LA Studio Comp could sometimes cause a drop in preset volume
- Presets created before 2.80 containing 64 controller assignments could be unable to switch snapshots after 2.80
- On rare occasions, scribble strips on the top row could duplicate that of the bottom row
- When set to “Per Preset”, Variax string volume settings may not be properly recalled
- Helix Native—An error message could appear when clicking redo after deleting a block
- Helix Native—After cutting or clearing a block, its bypass/controller assignments could be lost
- Helix Native—Stepping through presets in order could be redone reliably, but not undone
- Helix Native—When changing models, clicking Undo could inadvertently clear automation assignments of common parameters
- Helix Native—Could not instantiate in hardened runtime builds of Cubase 10.5
- Helix Native—When in Hardware Compatibility Mode for HX Stomp, a direct (dry) signal could be heard
- Helix Native—Undo/Redo was limited to 31 steps
- Helix Native—In rare cases, clicking Undo or Redo could change a Cab > Dual block into a Cab > Single block
- HX Edit—In some cases, an error message would appear when clicking redo after deleting a block
- HX Edit—After cutting or clearing a block, its bypass/controller assignments could be lost
- HX Edit—Newly created blocks on Path 2A could sometimes appear as None blocks
- HX Edit—After creating a Path 1B Input block, on rare occasions, paths could disappear, and blocks could be consistent when changing presets
- HX Edit—Importing a setlist could sometimes transmit a preset’s Command Center > Instant messages without loading the preset
- HX Edit—If the current preset has not yet been saved, importing a preset/setlist/bundle would not clear the undo history
- HX Edit—Undoing certain parameter changes could sometimes not work as expected
- HX Edit—Pressing your computer's Return/Enter key while backing up or restoring data could initiate an additional backup/restore
- HX Edit—Attempting to undo pasting to an Input or Output block could result in an error
- HX Edit—Copying/pasting footswitch assignments in the Command Center would work properly in HX Edit, but not on the hardware
- HX Edit—The 'Anderton's Amazing Multiband Presets' setlist on Marketplace could sometimes not import properly on Windows computers
- HX Edit—In rare cases, preset and IR files could sometimes not properly drag/drop from Explorer into HX Edit
- Many other minor bug fixes

# Known Issues in 2.82

- In rare cases, Helix/HX devices can become disconnected from HX Edit. If possible, always connect your Helix/HX device directly to the USB port closest to your computer's power connector. Never use any sort of USB hub, which may include the front USB ports on the front of towers
- Using Learn to quickly assign a footswitch to parameter control can occasionally change the switch’s Latching/Momentary setting
- If the Path 1A Input block is set to S/PDIF, it can stop passing audio after creating a Path 1B Input block
- Connecting an expression pedal to Helix Control can sometimes cause the pedal position display to behave erratically
- When connecting Helix to Powercab 112 Plus or 212 Plus, using presets to remotely change Powercab modes sometimes results in a brief volume increase
