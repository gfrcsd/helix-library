The AC15 was powered by a pair of EL84 tubes, an EF86-driven \"Normal\" channel, an ECC83-driven \"Vib-Trem\" channel, and rectified by an EZ81. The original first-generation AC30 used a GZ34 tube rectifier, three ECC83s (12AX7) for the Normal channel and the tremolo/vibrato oscillator/modulator circuits, one ECC81 (12AT7) phase inverter, and EL34 tubes in the power amplifier circuit.</p>","frontmatter":{"brand":"Vox","instrument":["Guitar"],"config":null,"channel":null,"path":"/models/amps/a-30-fawn-brt","model":"AC-30 Fawn (bright channel)","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_AC30","name":"A-30 Fawn Brt","type":null,"update":["1.0"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='325'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20325'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M52%20119H16v184h182c165%200%20183%200%20184-2%202-1%202-11%202-92v-91H236l-184%201'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.2300884955752212,"src":"/static/44ca5c4a9f9e1c9bf75daec26a82538a/91886/a-30-fawn.png","srcSet":"/static/44ca5c4a9f9e1c9bf75daec26a82538a/3ec60/a-30-fawn.png 139w,\n/static/44ca5c4a9f9e1c9bf75daec26a82538a/eb4f5/a-30-fawn.png 277w,\n/static/44ca5c4a9f9e1c9bf75daec26a82538a/91886/a-30-fawn.png 554w,\n/static/44ca5c4a9f9e1c9bf75daec26a82538a/e1551/a-30-fawn.png 831w,\n/static/44ca5c4a9f9e1c9bf75daec26a82538a/76ba0/a-30-fawn.png 944w","sizes":"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px"}}}},"fields":{"collection":"amps"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
